# tictactoe-rust
As a mentor I assign small programming projects so my mentees can practice new concepts. In this repository I do my own assignment with the common Tic Tac Toe project with the goal of maximizing type safety.

## TODO
- create error enum and string tests
- add unit and property tests
- add doc strings
- add usage section to readme
